I think, that may be I’m bad coder. My code is a mess (you could check it out on github). I know about patterns, I could talk you to blue about best practises, but still: my code is a mess.

Right now I’m talking about mistype’s code, but this thing has bugging me for years. If you try to dig into problem, you’ll find one question under all bullshit: is my knowledge *knowledge*? While it sounds absurdly at first, it isn’t. This question incorporates many others, like: does my knowledge apply to what I do? Do I change my behavior after I learn something new? Is knowledge without application a knowledge at all?

And I can’t find answers, mostly because if I honestly answer them, then I should call myself bad programmer without “maybe”. And I don’t want that.

Second tactic is to change my behavior so intuitive answer would not be Bad Coder. That is right thing, but hard. It’s funny how I lament about doing right hard thing, because any reason I can say in defense of that lament is weak. I was going to say about code culture in office and that implementing all these best practises in projects without usage is foolish.

No, it’s not.

Oh, I planned this post as practical but instead wrote about my fears. That and problems in post based on the same source. Lack of experience.
