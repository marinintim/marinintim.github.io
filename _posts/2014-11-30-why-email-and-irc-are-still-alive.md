title: 'Why email and IRC are still alive'

Many open source projects have support channel on IRC and anyone can be contacted via email. It’s 2014, why is that? Well, welcome to my thought train, I hope you’ll enjoy the ride.

Email is everywhere, everyone on the internet has one or more than one. You need it to register on facebook, twitter, github and others. You can sign up on many services using these oauth providers, but having account on ‘em implies existing email.

OpenID did not really take off because there was email. It was kind of complex to set up and strange to use. Strange enough not to use.

And then there are startups with goal to eliminate email. Asana, Slack, plenty of them. Are they successful? It depends on the viewpoint. Zoom to the team - ok, it is useful, great, reliable and other adjectives. Zoom out to whole internet - no, they don’t. And never would.

Because everyone already has email. It required in order of creating account on Asana and Slack too.

Almost all discussions about web standards are through email. After all, email is a protocol and Slack is a product. Or, email is an idea, which can survive centuries, Slack is an implementation, which would die without maintenance of creators.

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t dislike Slack, I love it. I use Asana everyday and sighs when I need to open Redmine instead of it. But still, email is not going to die anytime soon.

Imagine space colony three thousand years later. Somewhere near Alpha Centauri. Can you imagine folks in that colony using Slack? I can imagine them using email though.

Same goes with IRC. There’re a lot of chats around, but IRC is so common, that it is going last a long, long time. Also it feels a little hackerish without stickers and animated smiles. KISS in its finest.

In the long run standards survive, not products, - I should say, but it would be wrong. Yeah, HTML is still here, but so is Windows either. I don’t know how it works and would happy to be wrong in saying that Slack would not survive centuries.

But I doubt it. And I think that email will.
