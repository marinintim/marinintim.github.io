title: First year with Firefox OS
---
Three years ago I had dumbphone, which could only handle sms and phone
calls, two years ago [Denis](https://vk.com/denull) gave me iPhone 4
with which I spent a year, and after that I bought and started using
Firefox OS device, namely ZTE Open C.

It is my main (more correctly, only) phone-like device. I've chosen it
because I wanted to give FXOS a try and to build some webapps. My
first experience was quite smooth, I was able to call and receive
calls, send sms and more importantly connect to web. But after that my
enthusiasm kinda broke down. Sound level in browser apps was too low
([issue](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=822874) with no
workaround without changing os version), webapp devtools were not
quite good and something like that.

Surprisingly, as time goes by I developed new kind of feeling and
thinking about problems. If something doesn't work I don't try to hunt
down this bug to report it, because bugzilla is ugly and experience
with developers was kind of strange
